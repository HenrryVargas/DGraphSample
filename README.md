# DGraphSample #

*Please Note: This repository is a work in progress.*

I have written about working with Neo4j and the SQL Server Graph Database:

* [https://bytefish.de/blog/neo4j_at_scale_airline_dataset/](https://bytefish.de/blog/neo4j_at_scale_airline_dataset/)
* [https://bytefish.de/blog/sql_server_2017_graph_database/](https://bytefish.de/blog/sql_server_2017_graph_database/)

In this repository I want to analyze the Airline On Time Performance dataset using [Dgraph]:

> Dgraph is an open source, scalable, distributed, highly available and fast graph database, 
> designed from ground up to be run in production.

[Dgraph]: https://dgraph.io/
